This projects aims at doing "all" of a GM's works during a draft season. For that, I will make three models:

- One that predicts whether a draft pick (only) trade benefits one team or the other based on recent trades that happened and the differnece in the Approximate Value (player's success statistical measurement calculated by Pro Football Reference) generated by the trade for both teams (most specifically, their differece);

- Another one that predicts draft players' success in the NFL based on PFF grades, measurebles, and more;

- And a third that predicts a team's record on the following based on last season's record, strength of schedule in both seasons, team players' grades from past season (that stayed) and free agent additions, and more.

The latter two models appeared as ideas to compliment the first model, which is already done. This is because the one that predict draft players' success will not only be useful on its own, but also to improve the "trade chart" by taking into account the overall strength of the draft and of the remaining board. Similarly, the model that predicts a team's record on the following year will be useful since it will substitute the current dictionaru (if the user prefers so).

This model does a much better job at predicting the outcome of a pick when compared to the baseline model (predicting the mean of the target variable), with an error reduction of over 70%, I know the mean absolute error and mean squared error values achieved are high
